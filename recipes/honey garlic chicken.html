    <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>4 chicken breasts</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>¼ cup flour </li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>⅓ cup honey</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons rice vinegar or apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic minced</li>
        <li>Sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Sliced green onion</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h1>STEPS</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the chicken pieces all over with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Place the flour in a shallow dish.</li>
        <li>In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the honey, soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Coat the chicken in flour and place directly into the hot skillet. Cook until browned, about 5 minutes. Flip and brown on the other side, about 5 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce into the skillet and shake it to distribute throughout the pan. (It may bubble up quite a bit.) Turn the heat down to medium-low. Simmer for 3 minutes. Flip the chicken, coating the pieces in the sauce. Cook for another few minutes or until the chicken is cooked through. (If the sauce gets too thick, add a splash of water to thin it out.) Serve immediately and garnish with sliced green onion and sesame seeds, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
